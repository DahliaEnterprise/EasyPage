I think this folder may be deleted.
I believe the project for the developers mind bureau was going to be an abstract builder of connectable modules however if I remember correctly it now can only be solidified individualized projects which maybe down the road could be used as a reference for creating a buildable modules program.
Or was this supposed to be the folder for the output of the director instructions coding... hmmm
