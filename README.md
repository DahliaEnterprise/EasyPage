# Easy Page by Shasta Exchange
# The Interactivity Display

## Abstract Description

Facilitate the creation of digital pages that incorporate the workflow and usability of physical pages. This can also include but not limited to the incorporation of physical video playback frames, photo frames, and possibly market places and shopping carts.

## Easy Page, The Interactivity Display: Director Instructions

***The*** *Director Instructions* is synonymous with a **programming language**. The Director Instructions will be of only English alphabet symbols understanding, along with English numerical symbols and understanding. This is due to the nessecity of answering questions within the context of determining who is responsible and or liable; Which is the main goal of the Shasta Exchange products.

The Easy Page, Interactivity Display product, will only accept text input of English symbols, enabling the admittance of liabilities on a trigger basis. This achieves the goals of Shasta Exchange products by facilitating a distinct avenue of questioning regarding liabilities during the event of incurred liabilities.

Programs such as “What you see is what you get” applications will be forced to be compelled to produce Easy Page input that is compliant with its capabilities as opposed to producing a program that which its compliance within an interpreter(analogous to browsers) is non verifiable; This ensure that the intended page is displayed the same across devices and or operating systems.

## Easy Page, The digital standard for what would have been printed media

The Easy Page, Interactivity Display produces the effect that of only found in a printed book.

Tools can be dropped into the display either physically and or digitally in order to indicate that the viewers are mentally and or physically ready to enlarge a small photo that has a high definition source, including but not limited to beginning the playback of a video that is represented as a stationary image(play, pause, scroll tools).

Links are not of the usual paradigm as seen within browsers, games, and or applications; Instead the reader is referred to another “Book” of Easy Pages(which can have the “go to” precision of page, paragraph, and word).

Logical functions such as a market and shopping cart pair can be incorporated into an Easy Page book just as a person would order from a physically printed catalogue. Item numbers are copied to the analogy of a list of items to purchase and how many to purchase with their advertised prices, the customer then produces the similarities found within a phone call requesting which items and how many to be ordered and then the negotiation of selecting a payment option.

## Easy Page, What it is not.

Easy Page is not any “Web Version” and does not follow the “Web” crowd or standards, although it may use similar technologies such as TCP(and possibly UDP) to deliver data.

Easy Page has a mission to deliver stationary pages to achieve a sense of accomplishment due to measurable progress; It will not be incorporating the inherent ability to produce video games(The likeness of HTML5 games, and or WebGL games).

Easy Page does not have the download or upload paradigm, the entire structure of the book of easy pages is delivered to the recipient and the content is delivered per page request. This ensures that the intended experience does not change unless the recipient acknowledges that their promised content is no longer available and must have the updated book structure(and technically contents) delivered. All while not being proverbial forced to download the entire service content to ensure the “expected experience” quality of a printed book is enforced but digitally instead of physical.

<br>

## Easy Page, Proverbial Peripheral Nervous System.

Although Easy Page is quite simple it’s proverbial nervous system is absolutely not as simple as storing data on a service(hardware server), transmitting it to the correct recipients over a network, and displaying that content.

Easy Page service providers must be diligent with their file integrity checks and this may spawn a new type of hard drive/solid state drive 10 to 20 years into the future to ensure liabilities are allocated correctly in accordance to common law.

The entire burden of file integrity is placed on the encryption scheme used with browsers, games, and applications. Easy Page can use encryption based on the clients preferences and simultaneously use the file integrity schemes delivered by the Easy Page service provider whilst can also physically obtain the file integrity checksums direct from the provider. This can enable true file integrity whilst create a quasi monitoring system of the delivery supply chain for when a network delivery issue occurs and or when an man in the middle attack is in progress(or has occurred); Currently this type of alert does not exist in conventional means. The standard is: you are alerted when mass amount of customer’ data has not only been stolen/injected but also used against the customers in a detrimental and at a scale that has negatively impacted said customer and is of significant manner.

Easy Page client services have it most difficult within the pipeline of delivery as the display facility of easy page content but wait for all textual and photographic data to be delivered, commence file integrity checks per text block and per photographic data, then determine placement of the data will appear on the display within one render of frame within regards of the display. This may spawn a new type of monitor/display 20 to 30 years from now in order to ensure liabilities are allocated correctly within accordance to what the customers of Easy Page are being promised. This is not achievable with currently with out rendering textual and photographic data into a single image and then displaying that image which can be extremely slow when tools such as text selection and or highlighting and or playing/pausing/scrubbing a video within the page.

## Easy Page, What digital printed media means for Artifical Intelligence.

Easy pages will only allow predictable outcomes using the “deliver the entire book structure” paradigm; Artificial Intelligent based services using Easy Page programming language can exist, it’ outcomes are not predictable however the process is non changing(per delivered book structure).

Knowing the process can delineate a standard for the intended achievable results and can also prevent substitution of stationary content with a curator(a live person or artificial intelligence) with out consent and or knowledge of the recipients.

Predictable outcomes in conjunction with a logical programming language enables dynamic content with the ability to audit the reasoning behind the result of the outcome at (technically) any stage of the proverbial pipeline with the only requirement being a complete snapshot of a stage of the pipeline.

Perhaps the value and worth of predictable outcomes become more apparent with a more linear topic such as search engines, which is found within the next paragraph.

<br>

## Easy Page, Modern example of Easy Page:
### Search Engine as a Public Utility.

Results are previously indexed based on their utility within the context of the customers search.

Using a hash based checksum, results of a large data bank(thousands of terabytes) can produce the same exact results when searching with the exact text string and parameters allowing the customer to progress within their mission in between service changes and updates as opposed to progressing at the helplessness of seemingly random progress and depressions during service changes and updates.

- Due to the limitations of the hash based checksums and the intended goal, the customer can only be notified that their experience will become of random progress and regression due to the inability for the customer to receive terabytes of a data bank.

## Easy Page, The Interactivity Display: Symbol Integrity

Symbol integrity is an often overlooked attribute when transmitting textual data. The burden is placed on the common usage of ASCII(Now the common usage is UTF8).

It’s presumed that the signals sent within English speaking countries facilitated by Internet Service Providers and selectively interpreted by the receiving device would be ASCII or UTF8, enforced by encryption and data integrity hash checking. Encryption does not inherently come with this attribute nor does any segment of the pipeline enforce this attribute. It’s often unthought of but ascii binary can maskqurade it self with Chinese and or Russian letters all while producing phonetically English sounds and grammitically correct English phrases.

Symbol integrity would be an always on feature of Easy Page and can ensure that services like dictionary websites and or “American Sign Language” tutorial/education website will be displayed how the producer intended. This symbol integrity methodology can also be applied to other services.

### Notes and Caution

**Fair Use Disclosure**

Everything related to the Shasta Exchange products is considered proprietary and private by international tariff and national laws.
Being able to view the interworkings of the product does not authorize use in any way shape or form. The reasoning behind disclosing the interworkings of the products is to 
- Protect it' longevity(in the event of a server crash, and or malicious and non malicious result of data destruction there is a back up to get it running again)

- Utilize a "Poor man' Copyright" mechanism. (Having witnesses that are not known by the creator and or the business competitors is a great security feature for protecting property rights and most importantly enforcing those property rights.

Everything is developed for the developers mind until the "**Public Release**" that which is intended for the general public and disabled public use.
