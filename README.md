## Easy Page, The Interactivity Display: Director Instructions

***The*** *Director Instructions* is synonymous with a **programming language**. The Director Instructions will be of only English alphabet symbols understanding, along with English numerical symbols and understanding. This is due to the nessecity of answering questions within the context of determining who is responsible and or liable; Which is the main goal of the Shasta Exchange products.

The Easy Page, Interactivity Display product, will only accept text input of English symbols, enabling the admittance of liabilities on a trigger basis. This achieves the goals of Shasta Exchange products by facilitating a distinct avenue of questioning regarding liabilities during the event of incurred liabilities.

## Easy Page, The Interactivity Display: Symbol Integrity

Symbol integrity is an often overlooked attribute when transmitting textual data. The burden is placed on the common usage of ASCII(Now the common usage is UTF8).

 It’s presumed that the signals sent within English speaking countries facilitated by Internet Service Providers and selectively interpreted by the receiving device would be ASCII or UTF8, enforced by encryption and data integrity hash checking. Encryption does not inherently come with this attribute nor does any segment of the pipeline enforce this attribute. It’s often unthought of but ascii binary can maskqurade it self with Chinese and or Russian letters all while producing phonetically English sounds and grammitically correct English phrases.
